# Reporting issues

Please remember that this gem is merely **a wrapper** for the [jscrollpane-rails library](https://github.com/vitch/jScrollPane). This means that all issues
related to jScrollPane itself **should not be reported** here (there is a [separate issue tracker](https://github.com/vitch/jScrollPane/issues) for that).
I am not an author of jScrollPane and do not maintain it. Same for Turbolinks and jquery-rails gems.

If you wish to report a **problem related to this gem**, please provide

* Symptoms of the problem
* Your Rails version
* Version of the gem you are using
* Error stack trace
* Any errors/warnings displayed in the browser's console
* The code you are using to integrate and initialize jScrollPane

Thank you for understanding!
